''E. coli'' SOS System: DNA can be damaged by cross-linking agents, UV irradiation, alkylating agents, etc. Once damaged, RecA, a LexA protease, senses that damaged protein and becomes activated by removing its repressor. Once the LexA dimer repressor is removed, the expression of LexA operon is autoregulatory. In addition to being a LexA protease, the RecA protein also catalyzes a few novel DNA reactions such as annealing of single-stranded DNA and transfer of strands. The SOS system has enhanced DNA-repair capacity, including excision and post-replication repair, enhanced mutagenesis, prophage induction. The system can also inhibit cell division and cell respiration.

The '''SOS response''' is a global response to DNA damage in which the [[cell cycle]] is arrested and [[DNA repair]] and [[mutagenesis]] is induced. The system involves the [[RecA]] protein (Rad51 in eukaryotes). The RecA protein, stimulated by single-stranded DNA, is involved in the inactivation of the repressor ([[LexA]]) of SOS response genes thereby inducing the response. It is an error-prone repair system that contributes significantly to DNA changes observed in a wide range of species.

==Discovery==
The SOS response was discovered and named by [[Miroslav Radman]] in 1975.

==Mechanism==
During normal growth, the SOS genes are negatively regulated by LexA [[repressor protein]] dimers. Under normal conditions, LexA binds to a 20-bp consensus sequence (the [[SOS box]]) in the operator region for those genes. Some of these SOS genes are expressed at certain levels even in the repressed state, according to the affinity of LexA for their SOS box. Activation of the SOS genes occurs after DNA damage by the accumulation of single stranded (ssDNA) regions generated at replication forks, where [[DNA polymerase]] is blocked. RecA forms a filament around these ssDNA regions in an ATP-dependent fashion, and becomes activated. The activated form of RecA interacts with the LexA repressor to facilitate the LexA repressor's self-cleavage from the operator.

Once the pool of LexA decreases, repression of the SOS genes goes down according to the level of LexA affinity for the SOS boxes. Operators that bind LexA weakly are the first to be fully expressed. In this way LexA can sequentially activate different mechanisms of repair. Genes having a weak SOSbox (such as ''lexA'', ''recA'', ''uvrA'', ''uvrB'', and ''uvrD'') are fully induced in response to even weak SOS-inducing treatments. Thus the first SOS repair mechanism to be induced is [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER), whose aim is to fix DNA damage without commitment to a full-fledged SOS response. If, however, NER does not suffice to fix the damage, the LexA concentration is further reduced, so the expression of genes with stronger LexA boxes (such as ''sulA'', ''umuD'', ''umuC'' - these are expressed late) is induced. SulA stops [[cell division]] by binding to [[FtsZ]], the initiating protein in this process. This causes [[filamentation]], and the induction of UmuDC-dependent mutagenic repair. As a result of these properties, some genes may be partially induced in response to even endogenous levels of DNA damage, while other genes appear to be induced only when high or persistent DNA damage is present in the cell.

==Antibiotic resistance==
Recent research has shown that the SOS pathway may be essential in the acquisition of bacterial mutations which lead to [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to some antibiotic drugs. The increased rate of mutation during the SOS response is caused by three low-fidelity [[DNA polymerase]]s: [[Pol II]], [[Pol IV]] and [[Pol V]].

==Genotoxicity testing==

In ''Escherichia coli'', different classes of DNA-damaging agents can initiate the SOS response, as described above. Taking advantage of an operon fusion placing the [[lac operon]] (responsible for producing beta-galactosidase, a protein which degrades lactose) under the control of an SOS-related protein, a simple colorimetric assay for [[genotoxicity]] is possible. A lactose analog is added to the bacteria, which is then degraded by beta-galactosidase, thereby producing a colored compound which can be measured quantitatively through [[spectrophotometry]]. The degree of color development is an indirect measure of the beta-galactosidase produced, which itself is directly related to the amount of DNA damage. 
 
The ''E. coli'' are further modified in order to have a number of mutations including a uvrA mutation which renders the strain deficient in excision repair, increasing the response to certain DNA-damaging agents, as well as an rfa mutation, which renders the bacteria lipopolysaccharide-deficient, allowing better diffusion of certain chemicals into the cell in order to induce the SOS response. Commercial kits which measures the primary response of the ''E. coli'' cell to genetic damage are available and may be highly correlated with the [[Ames Test]] for certain materials.
