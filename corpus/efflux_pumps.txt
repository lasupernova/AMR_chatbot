All microorganisms, with a few exceptions, have highly conserved DNA sequences in their genome that are transcribed and translated to efflux pumps. Efflux pumps are capable of moving a variety of different toxic compounds out of [[cell (biology)|cells]], such as [[antibiotic]]s, heavy metals, organic pollutants, plant-produced compounds, quorum sensing signals, bacterial metabolites and [[neurotransmitter]]s via '''active efflux,''' which is vital part for [[xenobiotic metabolism]]. This active efflux mechanism is responsible for various types of resistance to bacterial pathogens within bacterial species - the most concerning being antibiotic resistance because microorganisms can have adapted efflux pumps to divert toxins out of the cytoplasm and into extracellular media.

Efflux systems function via an energy-dependent mechanism ([[active transport]]) to pump out unwanted toxic substances through specific efflux pumps. Some efflux systems are drug-specific, whereas others may accommodate multiple drugs with small multidrug resistance (SMR) transporters.

Efflux pumps are [[protein]]aceous transporters localized in the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] of all kinds of cells. They are [[active transport]]ers, meaning that they require a source of chemical energy to perform their function. Some are [[Active transport#Types|primary active transporters]] utilizing [[adenosine triphosphate]] hydrolysis as a source of energy, whereas others are [[Active transport#Types|secondary active transporters]] ([[uniporter]]s, [[symporter]]s, or [[antiporter]]s) in which transport is coupled to an [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping [[hydrogen]] or [[sodium]] [[ions]] into the cell.

== Bacterial ==

Bacterial efflux transporters are  classified into five major superfamilies, based on their [[amino acid]] [[peptide sequence|sequence]]  and the energy source used to export their substrates:

# The [[major facilitator superfamily]] (MFS)
# The [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ATP-binding cassette]] superfamily (ABC)
# The small multidrug resistance family (SMR)
# The [[Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division Superfamily (RND)|resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily (RND)]]
# The [[multi antimicrobial extrusion protein]] family (MATE).

Of these, only the ABC superfamily are primary transporters, the rest being [[secondary transporters]] utilizing [[proton]] or sodium [[ion gradient|gradient]] as a source of energy. Whereas MFS dominates in [[Gram positive bacteria]], the RND family was once thought to be unique to Gram negative bacteria. They have since been found in all major [[Kingdom (taxonomy)|kingdoms]].

=== Structure ===
Efflux pumps generally consist of an outer membrane protein, middle periplasmic protein, inner membrane protein, and transmembrane duct. The transmembrane duct is located in the outer membrane of the cell. The duct is also bound to two other proteins: a periplasmic membrane protein and an integral membrane transporter. The periplasmic membrane protein and the inner membrane protein of the system are coupled to control the opening and closing of the duct (channel). When a toxin binds to this inner membrane protein, the inner membrane proteins gives rise to a biochemical cascade that transmits signals to the periplasmic membrane protein and outer membrane protein to open the channel and move the toxin out of the cell. This mechanism uses an energy-dependent, protein-protein interaction that is generated by the transfer of the toxin for an H+ ion by the inner membrane transporter.

=== Function ===
Although antibiotics are the most clinically important substrates of efflux systems, it is probable that most efflux pumps have other natural physiological functions. Examples include:
* The ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' AcrAB  efflux system, which has a physiologic role of pumping out bile acids and fatty acids to lower their toxicity.
* The MFS family Ptr pump in ''[[Streptomyces]] pristinaespiralis'' appears to be an [[autoimmunity]] pump for this organism when it turns on production of pristinamycins I and II.
* The AcrAB–TolC system in ''E. coli'' is suspected to have a role in the transport of the calcium-channel components in the ''E. coli'' membrane.
* The MtrCDE system plays a  protective role by providing resistance to faecal lipids in rectal isolates of ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''.
* The AcrAB efflux system of ''[[Erwinia amylovora]]''  is important for this organism's [[virulence]], plant (host) colonization, and resistance to plant toxins.
* The MexXY component of the MexXY-OprM multidrug efflux system of ''P. aeruginosa'' is inducible by antibiotics that target ribosomes via the PA5471 gene product.

The ability of efflux systems to recognize a large number of compounds  other than their natural substrates is probably because substrate recognition is based on [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties, such as [[hydrophobicity]], [[aromaticity]] and [[ionization|ionizable]] character rather than on defined chemical properties, as in classical [[enzyme]]-[[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] or [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-[[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] recognition. Because most antibiotics are [[amphiphilic]] molecules - possessing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic characters - they are easily recognized by many efflux pumps.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

===Impact on antimicrobial resistance===
The impact of efflux mechanisms on [[antimicrobial resistance]] is large; this is usually attributed to the following:
* The [[gene]]tic elements encoding efflux pumps may be encoded on [[chromosome]]s and/or [[plasmids]], thus contributing to both intrinsic (natural) and acquired resistance respectively. As an intrinsic mechanism of resistance, efflux pump genes can survive a hostile environment (for example in the presence of antibiotics) which allows for the selection of [[mutant]]s  that over-[[gene expression|express]] these genes. Being located on transportable genetic elements as [[plasmids]] or [[transposon]]s is also advantageous for the microorganisms as it allows for the easy spread of efflux genes between distant species.
* Antibiotics can act as inducers and regulators of the [[gene expression|expression]] of some efflux pumps.
* Expression of several efflux pumps in a given bacterial species may lead to a broad spectrum of resistance when considering the shared substrates of some multi-drug efflux pumps,  where one efflux pump may confer resistance to a wide range of antimicrobials.

== Eukaryotic ==

In eukaryotic cells, the existence of efflux pumps has been known since the discovery of [[P-glycoprotein]] in 1976 by Juliano and [[Victor Ling|Ling]]. Efflux pumps are one of the major causes of anticancer drug resistance in eukaryotic cells. They include monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), [[multiple drug resistance]] proteins (MDRs)- also referred as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), peptide transporters (PEPTs), and Na+ phosphate transporters (NPTs). These transporters are distributed along particular portions of the renal proximal tubule, intestine, liver, blood–brain barrier, and other portions of the brain.

== Inhibitors ==
Several trials are currently being conducted to develop drugs that can be co-administered with antibiotics to act as inhibitors for the efflux-mediated extrusion of antibiotics. As yet, no efflux inhibitor has been approved for therapeutic use, but some are being used to determine the prevalence of efflux pumps in clinical isolates and in [[cell biology]] research. [[Verapamil]], for example, is used to block [[P-glycoprotein]]-mediated efflux of DNA-binding [[fluorophores]], thereby facilitating fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content. Various [[natural product]]s have been shown to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps including the carotenoids [[capsanthin]] and [[capsorubin]], the flavonoids [[rotenone]] and [[chrysin]], and the alkaloid [[lysergol]]. Some [[nanoparticle]]s, for example [[zinc oxide]], also inhibit bacterial efflux pumps.
