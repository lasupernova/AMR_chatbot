'''Bacteria'''; common noun '''bacteria''', singular '''bacterium''') are a type of [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]. They constitute a large [[domain (biology)|domain]] of [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s. Typically a few [[micrometre]]s in length, bacteria have a [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell morphology|number of shapes]], ranging from [[coccus|spheres]] to [[bacillus (shape)|rods]] and [[spiral bacteria|spirals]]. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on [[Earth]], and are present in most of its [[habitat]]s. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, [[Hot spring|acidic hot springs]], [[radioactive waste]], and the [[deep biosphere]] of the [[earth's crust]]. Bacteria also live in [[symbiotic]] and [[parasitic]] relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the [[bacterial phyla]] have species that can be [[microbiological culture|grown]] in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is known as [[bacteriology]], a branch of [[microbiology]].

Nearly all [[Life|animal life]] is dependent on bacteria for survival as only bacteria and some [[archaea]] possess the genes and enzymes necessary to synthesize [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], also known as [[cobalamin]], and provide it through the food chain.  Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is a water-soluble [[vitamin]] that is involved in the [[metabolism]] of every [[cell (biology)|cell]] of the human body.  It is a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]], and in both [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty acid]] and [[amino acid metabolism]]. It is particularly important in the normal functioning of the [[nervous system]] via its role in the [[myelinogenesis|synthesis of myelin]].

There are typically 40&nbsp;million bacterial [[cell (biology)|cells]] in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of [[fresh water]]. There are approximately 5×10<sup>30</sup> bacteria on Earth, forming a [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in many stages of the [[nutrient cycle]] by recycling nutrients such as the [[nitrogen fixation|fixation of nitrogen]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The nutrient cycle includes the [[decomposition]] of [[cadaver|dead bodies]]; bacteria are responsible for the [[putrefaction]] stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[cold seep]]s, [[extremophile]] bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as [[hydrogen sulphide]] and [[methane]], to energy.

In humans and most animals the largest number of bacteria exist in the [[gut flora|gut]], and a large number on the [[skin]].The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the [[immune system]], though many are [[probiotic|beneficial]], particularly in the gut flora. However, several species of bacteria are [[pathogenic bacteria|pathogenic]] and cause [[infectious disease]]s, including [[cholera]], [[syphilis]], [[anthrax]], [[leprosy]], and [[bubonic plague]]. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are [[respiratory infection]]s.  [[Tuberculosis]] alone kills about 2&nbsp;million people per year, mostly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. [[Antibiotic]]s are used to treat [[Infection|bacterial infections]] and are also used in farming, making [[antibiotic resistance]] a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in [[sewage treatment]] and the breakdown of [[oil spill]]s, the production of [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]] through [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in [[biotechnology]], and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.

Once regarded as [[plant]]s constituting the class ''Schizomycetes'' ("fission fungi"), bacteria are now classified as [[prokaryotes]]. Unlike cells of animals and other [[eukaryote]]s, bacterial cells do not contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and rarely harbour [[cell membrane|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]]s. Although the term ''bacteria'' traditionally included all prokaryotes, the [[scientific classification]] changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that [[evolution|evolved]] from an [[last universal common ancestor|ancient common ancestor]]. These [[domain (biology)|evolutionary domains]] are called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]''.

==Etymology==
The word ''bacteria'' is the plural of the [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|bacterium}}'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|?????????}} (''bakterion''), the diminutive of [[wikt:????????|????????]] (''bakteria''), meaning "staff, cane",because the first ones to be discovered were [[bacillus (shape)|rod-shaped]].

==Origin and early evolution==


The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the [[Abiogenesis|first forms of life]] to appear on Earth, about 4&nbsp;billion years ago. For about 3&nbsp;billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life. Although bacterial [[fossil]]s exist, such as [[stromatolite]]s, their lack of distinctive [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage. The [[most recent common ancestor]] of bacteria and archaea was probably a [[thermophile|hyperthermophile]] that lived about 2.5billion – 3.2billion years ago. The [[Earliest known life forms|earliest life]] on land may have been bacteria some 3.22&nbsp;billion years ago.

Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the [[Archaea]]. This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of [[alphaproteobacteria]]l [[symbiosis|symbionts]] to form either [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[hydrogenosome]]s, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly [[reduced form]], e.g. in ancient "amitochondrial" protozoa). Later, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed [[cyanobacteria]]-like organisms, leading to the formation of [[chloroplast]]s in algae and plants. This is known as [[primary endosymbiosis]].

==Morphology==
Bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes, called [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]]. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, ''[[Thiomargarita namibiensis]]'' is up to half a millimetre long and ''[[Epulopiscium fishelsoni]]'' reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which measure only 0.3&nbsp;micrometres, as small as the largest [[virus]]es. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these [[ultramicrobacteria]] are not well-studied.

Most bacterial species are either spherical, called ''[[coccus|cocci]]'' (''singular coccus'', from Greek ''kókkos'', grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called ''[[bacillus (shape)|bacilli]]'' (''sing''. bacillus, from [[Latin]] ''baculus'', stick). Some bacteria, called ''[[Spiral bacteria#Vibrio|vibrio]]'', are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called ''[[Spiral bacteria#Spirillum|spirilla]]'', or tightly coiled, called ''[[Spiral bacteria#Spirochete|spirochaetes]]''. A small number of other unusual shapes have been described, such as star-shaped bacteria. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial [[cell wall]] and [[cytoskeleton]], and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape [[predation|predators]].
[[File:Relative scale.svg|thumb|The range of sizes shown by [[prokaryote]]s, relative to those of other organisms and [[biomolecule]]s.]]

Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: ''[[Neisseria]]'' form diploids (pairs), ''[[Streptococcus]]'' form chains, and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' group together in "bunch of grapes" clusters. Bacteria can also group to form larger multicellular structures, such as the elongated [[filamentous bacteria|filaments]] of ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', the aggregates of ''[[Myxobacteria]]'', and the complex hyphae of ''[[Streptomyces]]''. These multicellular structures are often only seen in certain conditions. For example, when starved of amino acids, [[Myxobacteria]] detect surrounding cells in a process known as [[quorum sensing]], migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500&nbsp;micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; for example, about one in ten cells migrate to the top of a fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.

Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called [[biofilm]]s, and larger formations known as [[microbial mat]]s. These biofilms and mats can range from a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, [[protist]]s and [[archaea]]. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as [[microcolony|microcolonies]], through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of [[implant (medicine)|implanted]] [[medical device]]s, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.

==Cellular structure==

===Intracellular structures===
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a [[cell membrane]], which is made primarily of [[phospholipid]]s. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, [[protein]]s and other essential components of the [[cytoplasm]] within the cell. Unlike [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]], bacteria usually lack large membrane-bound structures in their cytoplasm such as a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells.However, some bacteria have protein-bound organelles in the cytoplasm which compartmentalize aspects of bacterial metabolism, such as the [[carboxysome]]. Additionally, bacteria have a multi-component [[prokaryotic cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]] to control the localisation of proteins and nucleic acids within the cell, and to manage the process of [[cell division]].

Many important [[biochemistry|biochemical]] reactions, such as energy generation, occur due to [[diffusion|concentration gradients]] across membranes, creating a [[Electrochemical potential|potential]] difference analogous to a battery. The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means these reactions, such as [[electron transport chain|electron transport]], occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the outside of the cell or [[periplasm]]. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called [[chlorosome]]s in [[green sulfur bacteria]].

Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, and their [[gene]]tic material is typically a single [[circular bacterial chromosome]] of [[DNA]] located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the [[nucleoid]]. The nucleoid contains the [[chromosome]] with its associated proteins and [[RNA]]. Like all other [[organism]]s, bacteria contain [[ribosome]]s for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of [[eukaryote]]s and [[Archaea]].

Some bacteria produce intracellular nutrient storage granules, such as [[glycogen]], [[polyphosphate]], [[sulfur] or [[polyhydroxyalkanoates]].Bacteria such as the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[cyanobacteria]], produce internal [[Vacuole#Bacteria|gas vacuoles]], which they use to regulate their buoyancy, allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels.

===Extracellular structures===

Around the outside of the cell membrane is the [[cell wall]]. Bacterial cell walls are made of [[peptidoglycan]] (also called murein), which is made from [[polysaccharide]] chains cross-linked by [[peptide]]s containing D-[[amino acid]]s. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], which are made of [[cellulose]] and [[chitin]], respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic [[penicillin]] ( produced by a fungus called ''Penicillium'') is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.

There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, that classify bacteria into [[Gram-positive bacteria]]  and [[Gram-negative bacteria]]. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the [[Gram stain]], a long-standing test for the classification of bacterial species.

Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and [[teichoic acid]]s. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] containing [[lipopolysaccharide]]s and [[lipoprotein]]s. Most bacteria have the Gram-negative cell wall, and only the [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]] (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative Gram-positive arrangement. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, [[vancomycin]] can kill only Gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against Gram-negative [[pathogen]]s, such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. Some bacteria have cell wall structures that are neither classically Gram-positive or Gram-negative. This includes clinically important bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacteria]]'' which have a thick peptidoglycan cell wall like a Gram-positive bacterium, but also a second outer layer of lipids.

In many bacteria, an [[S-layer]] of rigidly arrayed protein molecules covers the outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[diffusion barrier]]. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and contain surface [[enzyme]]s in ''[[Bacillus stearothermophilus]]''.
[[File:EMpylori.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Helicobacter pylori electron micrograph, showing multiple flagella on the cell surface|''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' electron micrograph, showing multiple flagella on the cell surface]]

[[Flagellum|Flagella]] are rigid protein structures, about 20&nbsp;nanometres in diameter and up to 20&nbsp;micrometres in length, that are used for [[motility]]. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of [[ion]]s down an [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell membrane.

[[Fimbria (bacteriology)|Fimbriae]] (sometimes called "[[pilus#Fimbriae|attachment pili]]") are fine filaments of protein, usually 2–10&nbsp;nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometres in length. They are distributed over the surface of the cell, and resemble fine hairs when seen under the [[electron microscope]]. Fimbriae are believed to be involved in attachment to solid surfaces or to other cells, and are essential for the virulence of some bacterial pathogens.[[Pilus|Pili]] (''sing''. pilus) are cellular appendages, slightly larger than fimbriae, that can transfer [[genetic material]] between bacterial cells in a process called [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] where they are called [[Pilus#Conjugative pili|conjugation pili]] or sex pili (see bacterial genetics, below). They can also generate movement where they are called [[pilus#type iv pili|type IV pili]].

[[Glycocalyx#Glycocalyx in Bacteria and Nature|Glycocalyx]] is produced by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised [[slime layer]] of [[extracellular polymeric substance]]s to a highly structured [[bacterial capsule|capsule]]. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as [[macrophage]]s (part of the human [[immune system]]). They can also act as [[antigen]]s and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces and the formation of biofilms.

The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on [[bacterial secretion system]]s. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the [[virulence]] of pathogens, so are intensively studied.

===Endospores===


Certain [[Genus|genera]] of Gram-positive bacteria, such as ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Sporohalobacter]]'', ''[[Anaerobacter]]'', and ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', can form highly resistant, dormant structures called ''[[endospore]]s''. Endospores develop within the cytoplasm of the cell; generally a single endospore develops in each cell. Each endospore contains a core of [[DNA]] and [[ribosome]]s surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by a multilayer rigid coat composed of peptidoglycan and a variety of proteins.

Endospores show no detectable [[metabolism]] and can survive extreme physical and chemical stresses, such as high levels of [[ultraviolet|UV light]], [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]], [[detergent]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, heat, freezing, pressure, and [[desiccation]].In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable for millions of years, and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the [[Hard vacuum|vacuum]] and radiation in space, possibly bacteria could be distributed throughout the [[Universe]] by [[space dust]], [[meteoroid]]s, [[asteroids]], [[comets]], [[Small Solar System body|planetoids]] or via [[directed panspermia]]. Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease: for example, [[anthrax]] can be contracted by the inhalation of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' endospores, and contamination of deep puncture wounds with ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' endospores causes [[tetanus]].

==Metabolism==

Bacteria exhibit an extremely wide variety of [[metabolism|metabolic]] types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into [[primary nutritional groups|nutritional groups]] on the basis of three major criteria: the source of [[Energy (biology)|energy]], the [[electron donor]]s used, and the source of [[carbon]] used for growth.

Bacteria either derive energy from light using [[photosynthesis]] (called [[phototrophy]]), or by breaking down chemical compounds using [[oxidation]] (called [[chemotroph]]y).Chemotrophs use chemical compounds as a source of energy by transferring electrons from a given electron donor to a [[terminal electron acceptor]] in a [[redox|redox reaction]]. This reaction releases energy that can be used to drive metabolism. Chemotrophs are further divided by the types of compounds they use to transfer electrons. Bacteria that use inorganic compounds such as hydrogren, [[carbon monoxide]], or [[ammonia]] as [[electron donor|sources of electrons]] are called [[lithotroph]]s, while those that use organic compounds are called [[organotroph]]s.

Many bacteria get their carbon from other [[organic compound|organic carbon]], called [[heterotroph]]y. Others such as [[cyanobacteria]] and some [[purple bacteria]] are [[autotroph]]ic, meaning that they obtain cellular carbon by [[Carbon fixation|fixing]] [[carbon dioxide]]. In unusual circumstances, the gas [[methane]] can be used by [[methanotroph]]ic bacteria as both a source of [[electron]]s and a substrate for carbon [[anabolism]].

In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] gas using the enzyme [[nitrogenase]]. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction, and [[acetogenesis]], respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to [[pollution]]; for example, [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ([[methylmercury|methyl-]] and [[dimethylmercury]]) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as [[ethanol]] in brewing) as waste. [[Facultative anaerobe]]s can switch between fermentation and different [[terminal electron acceptor]]s depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

==Growth and reproduction==

Unlike in multicellular organisms, increases in cell size ([[cell growth]]) and reproduction by [[cell division]] are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through [[binary fission]], a form of [[asexual reproduction]]. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8&nbsp;minutes.In cell division, two identical [[clone (genetics)|clone]] daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by ''[[Myxobacteria]]'' and aerial [[hypha]]e formation by ''[[Streptomyces]]'', or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.

In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid [[Growth medium|growth media]], such as [[agar plate]]s, are used to [[Isolation (microbiology)|isolate]] pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when the measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.

Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see [[r/K selection theory]]). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of [[algal bloom|algal]] (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple [[antibiotic]]s by ''[[Streptomyces]]'' that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., [[biofilm]]s) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ([[syntrophy]]).

[[Bacterial growth]] follows four phases. When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the [[Stationary phase (biology)|lag phase]], a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the [[Stationary phase (biology)|logarithmic phase]], also known as the exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid [[exponential growth]]. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the ''growth rate'' (''k''), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the ''generation time'' (''g''). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the ''[[Stationary phase (biology)|stationary phase]]'' and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased [[gene expression|expression of genes]] involved in [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant|antioxidant metabolism]] and [[active transport|nutrient transport]]. The final phase is the [[Stationary phase (biology)|death phase]] where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.

==Genetics==

Most bacteria have a single circular [[chromosome]] that can range in size from only 160,000 [[base pair]]s in the [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] bacteria ''[[Candidatus Carsonella ruddii|Carsonella ruddii]]'',to 12,200,000 base pairs (12.2 Mbp) in the soil-dwelling bacteria ''[[Sorangium cellulosum]]''. There are many exceptions to this, for example some ''[[Streptomyces]]'' and  ''[[Borrelia]]'' species contain a single linear chromosome, while some ''[[Vibrio]]'' species contain more than one chromosome. Bacteria can also contain [[plasmid]]s, small extra-chromosomal molecules of DNA that may contain genes for various useful functions such as [[antibiotic resistance]], metabolic capabilities, or various [[virulence|virulence factors]].

Bacteria genomes usually encode a few hundred to a few thousand genes. The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of [[intron]]s do exist in bacteria, these are much rarer than in eukaryotes.
Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit an identical copy of the parent's genomes and are [[Clonal colony|clonal]]. However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material [[DNA]] caused by [[genetic recombination]] or [[mutation]]s. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to [[mutagen]]s. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria. Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or "stress-directed mutation", where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate.

Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Many bacteria can [[natural competence|naturally]] take up DNA from the environment, while others must be chemically altered in order to induce them to take up DNA. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells. The second way bacteria transfer genetic material is by [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], when the integration of a [[bacteriophage]] introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome. Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and [[lytic cycle|lyse]] their [[host (biology)|host]] bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. Bacteria resist phage infection through [[restriction modification system]]s that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses [[CRISPR]] sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of [[RNA interference]]. The third method of gene transfer is [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact. In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called [[horizontal gene transfer]] and may be common under natural conditions.

==Behaviour==
===Movement===

Many bacteria are [[Motility|motile]] (able to move themselves) and do so using a variety of mechanisms. The best studied of these are [[Flagellum|flagella]], long filaments that are turned by a motor at the base to generate propeller-like movement. The bacterial flagellum is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the [[electrochemical gradient]] across the membrane for power.

Bacteria can use flagella in different ways to generate different kinds of movement. Many bacteria (such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'') have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional [[random walk]]. Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|monotrichous]]''), a flagellum at each end (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|amphitrichous]]''), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|lophotrichous]]''), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|peritrichous]]''). The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the [[spirochaete]]s, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive [[helix|helical]] body that twists about as it moves.

Two other types of bacterial motion are called [[twitching motility]] that relies on a structure called the [[pilus#type iv pili|type IV pilus]], and [[Bacterial gliding|gliding motility]], that uses other mechanisms. In twitching motility, the rod-like pilus extends out from the cell, binds some substrate, and then retracts, pulling the cell forward.

Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] in behaviours called '''[[taxis|taxes]]''': these include [[chemotaxis]], [[phototaxis]], [[taxis|energy taxis]], and [[magnetotaxis]].In one peculiar group, the [[myxobacteria]], individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The [[myxobacteria]] move only when on solid surfaces, unlike ''E. coli'', which is motile in liquid or solid media.
Several ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'' species move inside host cells by usurping the [[cytoskeleton]], which is normally used to move [[organelle]]s inside the cell. By promoting [[actin]] [[biopolymer|polymerisation]] at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.

===Communication===

A few bacteria have chemical systems that generate light. This [[bioluminescence]] often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.

Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as [[biofilms]], exchanging a variety of molecular signals for [[Cell signaling|inter-cell communication]], and engaging in coordinated multicellular behaviour.

The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labour, accessing resources that cannot effectively be used by single cells, collectively defending against antagonists, and optimising population survival by differentiating into distinct cell types.For example, bacteria in biofilms can have more than 500 times increased resistance to [[Bactericide|antibacterial]] agents than individual "planktonic" bacteria of the same species.

One type of inter-cellular communication by a molecular signal is called [[quorum sensing]], which serves the purpose of determining whether there is a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.

Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate [[gene expression]], and enables them to produce, release and detect [[autoinducer]]s or [[pheromones]] which accumulate with the growth in cell population.

==Classification and identification==

[[Scientific classification|Classification]] seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure, [[Cell metabolism|cellular metabolism]] or on differences in cell components, such as [[DNA]], [[fatty acid]]s, pigments, [[antigen]]s and [[quinone]]s.While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as [[lateral gene transfer]] between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises [[molecular systematics]], using genetic techniques such as [[guanine]] [[cytosine]] [[GC-content|ratio]] determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the [[ribosomal DNA|rRNA gene]]. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The [[International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology]] (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]].

The term "bacteria" was traditionally applied to all microscopic, single-cell prokaryotes. However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate [[domain (biology)|domains]], originally called ''Eubacteria'' and ''Archaebacteria'', but now called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]'' that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor.The archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria. These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the [[three-domain system]], which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiology. However, due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and a rapid increase in the number of genome sequences that are available, bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field. For example, [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith|Cavalier-Smith]] argued that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from Gram-positive bacteria.

The identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in [[medicine]], where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.

The ''[[Gram stain]]'', developed in 1884 by [[Hans Christian Gram]], characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls. The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the "Gram-positive" cell wall stain purple, while the thin "Gram-negative" cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and Gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or ''Nocardia'', which show [[acid-fast]]ness on [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|Ziehl–Neelsen]] or similar stains. Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as [[serology]].

[[Microbiological culture|Culture]] techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens; for example, a [[sputum]] sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause [[pneumonia]], while [[feces|stool]] specimens are cultured on [[selective media]] to identify organisms that cause [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as [[blood]], [[urine]] or [[cerebrospinal fluid|spinal fluid]], are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] growth), [[hemolysis (microbiology)|patterns of hemolysis]], and staining.

As with bacterial classification, identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods. Diagnostics using DNA-based tools, such as [[polymerase chain reaction]], are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods. These methods also allow the detection and identification of "[[viable but nonculturable]]" cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing. However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty. Following present classification, there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes, which includes bacteria and archaea;but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> total species—and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude.

==Interactions with other organisms==

Despite their apparent simplicity, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. These [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations can be divided into [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[commensalism]]. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and [[Perspiration|sweat]], and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of [[body odor|body odour]].

===Predators===
Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called ''predatory bacteria''. These include organisms such as ''[[Myxococcus xanthus]]'', which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients, such as ''[[Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus]]'',or invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol, such as ''Daptobacter''.These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from [[Detritivore|saprophages]] that consumed dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms.
===Mutualists===
Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of [[anaerobic bacteria]] that consume [[organic acid]]s, such as [[butyric acid]] or [[propionic acid]], and produce [[hydrogen]], and [[methanogen]]ic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.

In soil, microorganisms that reside in the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]] (a zone that includes the [[root]] surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out [[nitrogen fixation]], converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as [[symbiont]]s [[Bacteria in the human body|in humans]] and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human [[gut flora]] of the [[intestine]]s can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise [[vitamin]]s, such as [[folic acid]], [[vitamin K]] and [[biotin]], convert [[Milk protein|sugars]] to [[lactic acid]] (see ''[[Lactobacillus]]''), as well as fermenting complex undigestible [[carbohydrate]]s. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through [[competitive exclusion]]) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as [[probiotic]] [[dietary supplement]]s.

===Pathogens===

If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as [[tetanus]] (Caused by ''Clostridium tetani''), [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]], [[cholera]], [[foodborne illness]], [[leprosy]] (caused by ''Micobacterium leprae)'' and [[tuberculosis]] (Caused by ''Mycobacterium tubeculosis''). A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' and [[Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori|peptic ulcer disease]]. Bacterial diseases are also important in [[agriculture]], with bacteria causing [[leaf spot]], [[fire blight]] and [[Wilting|wilts]] in plants, as well as [[Johne's disease]], [[mastitis]], [[salmonellosis|salmonella]] and [[anthrax]] in farm animals.

Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Some organisms, such as ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus]]'', can cause skin infections, [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and even overwhelming [[sepsis]], a systemic [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] producing [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], massive [[vasodilator|vasodilation]] and death. Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the [[nose]] without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the [[Rickettsia]], which are [[obligate intracellular parasite]]s able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes [[typhus]], while another causes [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. ''[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]]'', another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or [[urinary tract infection]] and may be involved in [[coronary heart disease]]. Finally, some species, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Burkholderia cenocepacia]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'', are [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]] and cause disease mainly in people suffering from [[immunosuppression]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].

Bacterial infections may be treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which are classified as [[Bactericide|bacteriocidal]] if they kill bacteria, or [[bacteriostatic]] if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are [[chloramphenicol]] and [[puromycin]], which inhibit the bacterial [[ribosome]], but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in [[intensive farming]] to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by [[antiseptic]] measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilised]] to prevent contamination by bacteria. [[Disinfectant]]s such as [[bleach]] are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.

==Significance in technology and industry==

Bacteria, often [[lactic acid bacteria]], such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' and ''[[Lactococcus]]'', in combination with [[yeast]]s and [[Mold (fungus)|moulds]], have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods, such as [[cheese]], [[Pickling|pickles]], [[soy sauce]], [[sauerkraut]], [[vinegar]], [[wine]] and [[yogurt]].

The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and [[bioremediation]]. Bacteria capable of digesting the [[hydrocarbon]]s in [[petroleum]] are often used to clean up [[oil spill]]s. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in [[Prince William Sound]] in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]]. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the [[bioremediation]] of industrial [[toxic waste]]s. In the [[chemical industry]], bacteria are most important in the production of [[enantiomer]]ically pure chemicals for use as [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceuticals]] or [[agrichemical]]s.

Bacteria can also be used in the place of [[pesticide]]s in the [[biological pest control]]. This commonly involves ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (also called BT), a Gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a [[Lepidoptera]]n-specific [[insecticide]]s under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as [[environmentally friendly]], with little or no effect on humans, [[wildlife]], [[pollinator]]s and most other [[beneficial insect]]s.

Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, [[enzyme]]s and [[metabolic pathway]]s in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme kinetic]] and [[gene expression]] data into [[mathematical model]]s of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of ''Escherichia coli'' metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to [[bioengineering|bioengineer]] bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as [[insulin]], [[growth factor]]s, or [[antibody|antibodies]].

Because of their importance for research in general, samples of bacterial strains are isolated and preserved in [[Biological Resource Centers]]. This ensures the availability of the strain to scientists worldwide.

==History of bacteriology==

Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1676, using a single-lens [[microscope]] of his own design.He then published his observations in a series of letters to the [[Royal Society of London]]. Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek's most remarkable microscopic discovery. They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and, in one of the most striking hiatuses in the history of science, no one else would see them again for over a century. His observations had also included protozoans which he called [[animalcule]]s, and his findings were looked at again in the light of the more recent findings of  [[cell theory]].

[[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] introduced the word "bacterium" in 1828. In fact, his ''[[Bacterium (genus)|Bacterium]]'' was a genus that contained non-spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria, as opposed to ''Bacillus'', a genus of spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria defined by Ehrenberg in 1835.

[[Louis Pasteur]] demonstrated in 1859 that the growth of microorganisms causes the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] process, and that this growth is not due to [[spontaneous generation]] ([[yeast]]s and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather [[fungus|fungi]]). Along with his contemporary [[Robert Koch]], Pasteur was an early advocate of the [[germ theory of disease]].

Robert Koch, a pioneer in medical microbiology, worked on [[cholera]], [[anthrax]] and [[tuberculosis]]. In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1905. In [[Koch's postulates]], he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a [[disease]], and these postulates are still used today.

[[Ferdinand Cohn]] is said to be a founder of bacteriology, studying bacteria from 1870. Cohn was the first to classify bacteria based on their morphology.

Though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases, no effective [[antiseptic|antibacterial]] treatments were available. In 1910, [[Paul Ehrlich]] developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''—the [[spirochaete]] that causes [[syphilis]]—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on [[immunology]], and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the [[Gram stain]] and the [[Ziehl–Neelsen stain]].

A major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when [[Carl Woese]] recognised that [[archaea]] have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new [[phylogenetic]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] depended on the [[sequencing]] of [[16S ribosomal RNA]], and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the [[three-domain system]].
