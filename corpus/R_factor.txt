'''Resistance transfer factor''' (shortened as R-factor or RTF) is an old name for a [[plasmid]] that codes for [[antibiotic resistance]]. R-factor was first demonstrated in ''[[Shigella]]'' in 1959 by Japanese scientists. Often, R-factors code for more than one antibiotic resistance factor: genes that encode resistance to unrelated [[antibiotics]] may be carried on a single R-factor, sometimes up to 8 different resistances.  Many R-factors can pass from one [[bacterium]] to another through [[bacterial conjugation]] and are a common means by which antibiotic resistance spreads between bacterial species, genera and even families. For example, RP1, a plasmid that encodes resistance to [[ampicillin]], [[tetracycline]] and [[kanamycin]] originated in a species of ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', from the family [[Pseudomonadaceae]], but can also be maintained in bacteria belonging to the family [[Enterobacteriaceae]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.

Bacteria containing F-factors (said to be "F+") have the capability for [[horizontal gene transfer]]; they can construct a sex [[pilus]], which emerges from the donor bacterium  and ensnares the recipient bacterium, draws it in, and eventually triggers the formation of a mating bridge, merging the cytoplasms of two bacteria via a controlled pore. This pore allows the transfer of genetic material, such as a [[plasmid]]. Conjugation allows two [[bacteria]], not necessarily from the same [[species]], to transfer genetic material one way. Since many R-factors contain F-plasmids, antibiotic resistance can be easily spread among a population of [[bacteria]]. Also, R-factors can be taken up by "DNA pumps" in their membranes via [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]], or less commonly through viral mediated [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], or via bacteriophage, although conjugation is the most common means of antibiotic resistance spread. They contain the gene called RTF (Resistance transfer factor).
